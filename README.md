# BookStore
A basic Bookstore webpage created using NodeJS for a college project.<br>
you can visist the website here: https://cryptic-cove-43919.herokuapp.com/ <br>
<br>
<br>
Basic functionalities includes: <br>
Registering and logging in <br>
presonlized wishlist for every user <br>
search for books using keywords.<br>
<br>
since the website only needs a database for users and their respsective wishlist <br>
we were asked to store the data in JSON files.<br>
<br>
I've only worked on the backend and the college provided us with HTML files.. <br>
so this is not my design and this is why it's designed for Desktop and not mobile.<br>
<br>
The main purpose of this project was to learn server sided get and post requests.
